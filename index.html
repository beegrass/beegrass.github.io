<h1>A Short Paragraph About Me</h1>
<p>I graduated from Patchogue-Medford High School in 2021 and in my senior year I worked at a thrift store named "Savers" until I had to leave for surgery in July. The surgery was for what's called an osteoblastoma which is a slow-growing tumor that dissolves normal, healthy bone. I had it in my left temporal region which left my inner ear canal pushed shut and my left TMJ dissolved. Now I have a titanium TMJ! It's pretty rad. Besides that, I like to play video games like Minecraft and Genshin Impact. My usual hobbies off of technology are crocheting and sewing, I also occasionally draw.</p>

<p>Bao buns are my favorite food. Though the competition between them and soup dumplings is fierce</p>
